    <h1>Franklin Richards</h1>

        <p>Since his birth, Franklin Richards has been one of the Marvel Universe's most powerful mutants. His reality-bending abilities potentially even made him the most powerful being in all of existence. However, that hasn't been the case recently, as his powers have mysteriously started to short out. Despite the combined efforts of Mister Fantastic, Doctor Doom and the X-Men, the cause of Franklin's dwindling mutant powers are a mystery.</p>

        <p>And as Fantastic Four #26 reveals, Franklin Richards, one of the most potentially powerful of the Omega-Level mutants, isn't actually a mutant at all, a detail that has cost Franklin his coveted place among the X-Men on the mutant homeland Krakoa.</p>
        <p>Since using much of his internal power to salvage the post-Secret Wars Marvel Multiverse and barely escaping a conflict with the Griever, Franklin Richards and his reality-altering abilities have been running on fumes. Neither Reed Richards nor the mutant geniuses on Krakoa could uncover the true reason for this drop in power -- at least not before he used up all of his remaining energy fighting against the Cormorant. This seems to have reverted Franklin to a base-line human, with the Krakoa Gate no longer recognizing him as a mutant and Professor X not allowing him to come back to the island nation.</p>
        <p>After Valeria figures out the key to using the Forever Gate to reach across dimensions, Franklin quickly prepares to try and return to Krakoa. But he gets a telepathic message from Professor Charles Xavier -- telling him not to do that. Xavier reveals that the true reason he and the rest of the mutants can't figure out how to fix Franklin's powers is that they're not actually mutant powers. Thanks to the cosmic reality-altering aspects of his powers, a young Franklin Richards unknowingly altered the cells in his body to make it so he would have the X-Gene when he dreamed of being someone special.</p>
        <p>But with his powers gone, his genetic structure has returned to that of a regular human, with Cerebro apparently even confirming that Franklin isn't really a mutant, and actually never has been. He's just been a reality-warper who believed himself to be a mutant, so the rest of the world adapted to that belief. Although Xavier knows this clearly leaves him with a lot of questions, Xavier doesn't have any. With more pressing matters to attend to, Xavier bluntly ends the conversation by telling Franklin he is no longer welcome on Krakoa.</p>
        <p>It's a major shift in the cosmology of the Marvel Universe, where Franklin Richards wasn't just a mutant but an Omega-Level mutant. He's been frequently shown to be one of the single most powerful forces in the entire Marvel Universe, eventually even growing so powerful in his adulthood that he becomes a contemporary of the likes of Galactus. Galactus even refers to Franklin as history's most powerful mutant at the end of time.</p>
